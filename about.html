            <p class="aboutus"><span style="margin-left: 1em"></span>Harmony Essence Creations was born from a journey around the world.
                 After five enriching years as a Flight Attendant,
                 exploring diverse cultures and landscapes, I developed a deep appreciation for the power of scents and the harmony they bring.
                 Inspired by the fragrances discovered during my travels, particularly in Asian countries well-known for their aromatic traditions,
                I decided to turn this passion into a pursuit.</p>
                <p class="aboutus"><span style="margin-left: 1em"></span>Thus, Harmony Essence Creations was created, a reflection of my globe exploration and a commitment to infuse the essence of those 
                moments into hand-poured soy candles, creating a pure glow that captures the spirit of my international experiences.</p>
