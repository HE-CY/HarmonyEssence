                <p>🕯️ Initial burning of candle should be approximately 1 hour per 2,5 cm of candle diameter.
                <p>🕯️ Trim the wick to 0.5cm each time before burning. This will help prevent soot and extend the life of the candle. Also if wick develops a mushroom carbo tip, extinguish the candle.
                <p>🕯️ If the candle burns one-sided, you may gently push over the burning wick to the side. Do not bend a cooled down wick (it may break).
                <p> 🕯️ Never leave a candle burning unattended. Burn candles out of reach of children and pets.
                    <p> 🕯️ Always put candles on a heat-resistant or a non-flammable base.
                        <p> 🕯️ Never burn a candle on or near anything that can catch fire.
                            <p>🕯️ Do not burn candles in a draft.
                                <p>🕯️ Place burning candles at least 10 cm apart from one another.
                                    <p>🕯️ Keep the wax pool free of wick trimmings, matches and debris at all times.
                                        <p> 🕯️ Never move a burning candle. Allow the candle to cool and solidify before moving. The candle container and wax can become extremely hot when in use.
                                            <p>🕯️ Never extinguish candles with water.
                                                <p>🕯️ Never use a candle as a night light.
